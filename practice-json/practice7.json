  "readingPassage": "One of the modern worlds intriguing sources of mystery has been aeroplanes vanishing in mid-flight. One of the more famous of these was the disappearance in 1937 of a pioneer woman aviator, Amelia Earhart. On the second last stage of an attempted round the world flight, she had radioed her position as she and her navigator searched desperately for their destination, a tiny island in the Pacific. The plane never arrived at Howland Island. Did it crash and sink after running out of fuel? It had been a long haul from New Guinea, a twenty-hour flight covering some four thousand kilometres. Did Earhart have enough fuel to set down on some other island on her radioed course? Or did she end up somewhere else altogether? One fanciful theory had her being captured by the Japanese in the Marshall Islands and later executed as an American spy; another had her living out her days under an assumed name as a housewife in New Jersey.\nSeventy years after Earhart's disappearance, 'myth busters' continue to search for her. She was the best-known American woman pilot in the world. People were tracking her flight with great interest when, suddenly, she vanished into thin air. Aircraft had developed rapidly in sophistication after World War One, with the 1920s and 1930s marked by an aeronautical record-setting frenzy. Conquest of the air had become a global obsession. While Earhart was making headlines with her solo flights, other aviators like high-altitude pioneer Wiley Post and industrialist Howard Hughes were grabbing some glory of their own. But only Earhart, the reserved tomboy from Kansas who disappeared three weeks shy of her 40th birthday, still grips the public imagination. Her disappearance has been the subject of at least fifty books, countless magazine and newspaper articles, and TV documentaries. It is seen by journalists as the last great American mystery.\nThere are currently two main theories about Amelia Earhart's fate.\nThere were reports of distress calls from the Phoenix Islands made on Earhart's radio frequency for days after she vanished. Some say the plane could have broadcast only if it were on land, not in the water. The Coast Guard and later the Navy, believing the distress calls were real, adjusted their searches, and newspapers at the time reported Earhart and her navigator were marooned on an island. No-one was able to trace the calls at the time, so whether Earhart was on land in the Phoenix Islands or there was a hoaxer in the Phoenix Islands using her radio remains a mystery. Others dismiss the radio calls as bogus and insist Earhart and her navigator ditched in the water. An Earhart researcher, Elgen Long, claims that Earhart's airplane ran out of gas within fifty-two miles of the island and is sitting somewhere in a 6,000-square-mile area, at a depth of 17,000 feet. At that depth, the fuselage would still be in shiny, pristine condition if ever anyone were able to locate it. It would not even be covered in a layer of silt. Those who subscribe to this explanation claim that fuel calculations, radio calls and other considerations all show that the plane plunged into the sea somewhere off Howland Island.\nWhatever the explanation, the prospect of finding the remains is unsettling to many. To recover skeletal remains or personal effects would be a grisly experience and an intrusion. They want to know where Amelia Earhart is, but that's as far as they would like to go. As one investigator has put it, â€œI'm convinced that the mystery is part of what keeps us interested. In part, we remember her because she's our favourite missing person.",
