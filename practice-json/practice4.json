  "readingPassage": "The Earth's atmosphere is a thin layer of gases that surrounds the planet and is held in place by gravity. It plays a crucial role in supporting life, regulating temperature, and protecting the Earth from harmful solar radiation. The atmosphere is composed primarily of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), with trace amounts of other gases such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, and methane.\nThe atmosphere is divided into several layers, each with distinct characteristics and functions. The troposphere is the lowest layer and is where most weather phenomena occur. It extends from the Earth's surface to an altitude of about 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) at the poles and 18 kilometers (11 miles) at the equator.\nAbove the troposphere is the stratosphere, which extends from about 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) to 50 kilometers (31 miles) above the Earth's surface. The stratosphere contains the ozone layer, which absorbs and scatters ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun, protecting life on Earth from harmful UV rays.\nThe mesosphere is the third layer of the atmosphere, extending from about 50 kilometers (31 miles) to 85 kilometers (53 miles) above the Earth's surface. It is characterized by decreasing temperatures with increasing altitude and is where meteors burn up upon entering the Earth's atmosphere.\nThe thermosphere is the fourth layer of the atmosphere and extends from about 85 kilometers (53 miles) to 600 kilometers (373 miles) above the Earth's surface. It is where the International Space Station orbits and is characterized by extremely high temperatures due to the absorption of solar radiation.\nThe exosphere is the outermost layer of the Earth's atmosphere, extending from about 600 kilometers (373 miles) to 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) above the Earth's surface. It gradually transitions into outer space and is where satellites orbit the Earth.\nThe Earth's atmosphere plays a vital role in regulating the planet's climate and weather patterns. It absorbs solar radiation, warms the Earth's surface, and emits infrared radiation back into space. This process, known as the greenhouse effect, helps maintain Earth's average temperature and makes the planet habitable.\nHowever, human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, have led to an increase in greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane, enhancing the greenhouse effect and contributing to global warming and climate change.\nThe atmosphere also plays a crucial role in the water cycle, with water vapor evaporating from the Earth's surface, condensing into clouds, and precipitating as rain or snow. This cycle replenishes freshwater sources, sustains ecosystems, and influences weather patterns.\nIn addition to its role in supporting life and regulating climate, the Earth's atmosphere protects the planet from harmful solar radiation and cosmic rays. The ozone layer in the stratosphere absorbs most of the Sun's UV radiation, preventing damage to DNA and reducing the risk of skin cancer and other health effects.\nOverall, the Earth's atmosphere is a dynamic and complex system that sustains life, regulates climate, and protects the planet from the harsh conditions of space. Understanding its composition, structure, and functions is essential for addressing environmental challenges and ensuring the well-being of future generations.",
